                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; Hades is a roguelike action dungeon crawler video game developed and published by Supergiant Games. In Hades, you play as 
                        Zagreus, the son of Hades, as you attempt to escape from the Underworld to reach Mount Olympus. Each run challenges
                        you through a random series of rooms populated with enemies and rewards. The game has a hack and slash combat system,
                        and you use a combination of main weapon attacks, special attacks, a dash ability, and a magic ability to defeat enemies
                        while trying to take as little damage as you can to progress as far as possible. One of the key elements of the game is 
                        that you will die - repeatedly - and after each run you will gain treasures that will allow you to improve certain 
                        attributes or unlock new weapons and abilities to improve your chances of escaping on your next run.

                    <h2>Weapons</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; In Hades you have a range of 6 base weapons - Infernal Arms - to choose from in order to slay your enemies. To unlock the different weapons
                        you must collect <span class="miniImage">Chthonic Keys</span>, which can be found in the different rooms of the Underworld. Each weapons also comes with three                        
                        forms to choose from, each of which come with their own unique abilities. In order to unlock these different forms you have to defeat bosses
                        during your run and obtain a special item called <span class="miniImage">Titan Blood</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Stygius</h3>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; The first weapon you start with is <span class="miniImage">Stygius</span>. Stygius, the Blade of the Underworld, was once wielded by 
                            Poseidon, but after being fragmented, it is now wielded by Zagreus in his attempt to escape the Underworld. The blade's default attack pattern is a 
                            three-swing long combo consisting of a mixture of wide and directional swings. The special creates a small burst around you after a short jump, and 
                            leaves you stationary for a short time.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Varatha</h3>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; To unlock one of my personal favorite weapons you must use 4 Chthonic Keys. The <span class="miniImage">Varatha</span> was once wielded by
                            Hades himself during the battle with the Titans and the Olympians. Now Varatha is used by Zagreus, ironically enough, to defeat Hades and escape from 
                            the Underworld. The blades attack pattern consists of repeated long-range stab attacks that can be charged to unleash a spin attack dealing high damage 
                            in a wide radius. The special throws the spear, which will damage enemies along its path until it stops. Activating special again recalls the spear, which 
                            will deal damage on the way back.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Aegis</h3>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; Another one of my favorite weapons can be unlocked using 3 Chthonic Keys. The <span class="miniImage">Aegis</span>, known as the Shield of
                            Chaos on Olympus, was wielded first by Lord Zeus in his battle with the Titans and then it was passed down to his daughter Athena. Now it Zagreus's turn
                            to wield the mighty shield as he tries to escape from the Underworld. Aegis's main attack is a single swing that hits in an arc and knocks enemies back. 
                            Holding the attack button will block damage from the front, while charging the "Bull Rush". Releasing this will perform a shield bash forwards, dealing 
                            damage to enemies hit. The special throws the shield, which bounces between enemies and objects before returning.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Coronacht</h3>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; One of the first weapons you will unlock only costs a single Chthonic Key - <span class="miniImage">Coronacht</span>. Also known as the 
                            Heart-Seeking Bow, Coronacht was once wielded by none other than Mistress Hera, who stood side by side with Zeus as they drove back the Titans into the
                            Underworld. Coronacht uses ranged attacks that hit enemies at a distance. The main attack can be charged to increase distance and damage, releasing at 
                            the right moment for additional damage. The special sprays arrows in a cone in front of you.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Malphon</h3>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; One of the more expensive weapons to unlock is <span class="miniImage">Malphon</span> which costs 8 Chthonic Keys. Also known as the Twin 
                            Fists of Malphon were forged by an ancient cyclopean forgemaster who delieved the fists to the gods, where it was by Demeter. Malphon uses fast 
                            repetitive short-range combo attacks using fists in close-quarters combat. The special is an uppercut that hits twice. This weapon is unique due to it 
                            being the only Infernal Arm with a dash-special; if the special is used while dashing it will uppercut faster but only hit once.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Exagryph</h3>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; Another weapon that is quite expensive to unlock is <span class="miniImage">Exagryph</span>, costing you 8 Chthonic Keys. Least known among 
                            the gods who stood together to depose the Titans is the Lady Hestia, reclusive goddess of the hearth, and one-time wielder of Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant; 
                            an artifact of metal and of flame so dreadful that the gods themselves abandoned it once their fell work was done. Exagryph uses automatic or manual fire 
                            (depending on whether Attack is pressed or held) that must be reloaded once all ammo is used. The special launches a grenade to bombard the target area, 
                            which takes a short time to arrive but deals damage in an area once it lands.
