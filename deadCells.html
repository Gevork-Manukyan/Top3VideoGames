                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; Dead Cells is a roguelike video game developed and published by Motion Twin. In Dead Cells you take the role of an 
                        amorphous creature puppeteering a decapitated corpse in a dungeon, through which you must fight your way out. You gain 
                        various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated, or randomly generated, levels to fight 
                        undead creatures within it. At times, you gain "cells", a type of in-game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades 
                        or unlock items. Dead Cells uses a permadeath system, which means you lose all cells and other currencies and items upon each instance of death.

                    <h2>Biomes</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; Biomes are the different areas within Dead Cells that you must travel through to complete the game. The base game currently has 15 main biomes and 
                        4 boss biomes, however the current DLC's available add another 7 main biomes and 6 more boss biomes.  The order in which biomes are encountered, 
                        and the general location of their links, are predetermined. A link is the doorway to the next stage and multiple links can be found in any given biome.
                        And while the location and ordering of the biomes are predetermined, they are divided into levels and only one biome of each level can be accessed in a 
                        run which gives you a lot of flexibility and change each run. A map of the biomes and their ordering can be found <a class="link" href="./assests/deadcells/deadCells_map.png" target="_blank">here</a> 
                        or on the <a class="link" href="https://deadcells.fandom.com/wiki/Biomes_Map" target="_blank">fandom wiki</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; Within each run, biomes are procedurally generated within the confines of that biome's set parameters. This puts the focus of gameplay on a combination
                        of on the moment adaptation and memorization, with each biome having a distinct feel. Each biome also has a set of enemies that you will encounter, 
                        some of them are unique to a specific biome. Higher difficulties change the enemy distribution up.

                    <h2>Gear</h2>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp; There are 3 types of gear in Dead Cells: weapons, skills, and amulets. Each type of gear can be one of three types of stats - Brutality, Tactics, or Survival - 
                            where each stat comes with it's own bonus, whether it be a health boost, attack boost, speed boost, etc.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="deadCellsGearList">
                            <li><b>Weapons</b> - have limited but different movesets (swords, hammers, shields, bows, etc.)</li>
                            <li><b>Skills</b> - cause a variety of effects but must cool down between uses (traps, gernades, powers, etc.)</li>
                            <li><b>Amulets</b> - passive items which grant powerful offensive or defensive benefits</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Gear also have a power, or leveling, system which is indicated by a roman numeral next to the gear name. A piece of gear can range any where from power 1 to power 10, 
                            however gear can also have a 'quality' which is attached to the power level of the gear. These qualities are '+', '++', 'S', and 'L'. Each quality affects gear in a 
                            specific way:
                        </p>

                        <ul class="deadCellsGearList">
                            <li><span class="boldPlus">+</span> - adds +2 to gear power</li>
                            <li><span class="boldPlus">++</span> - adds +4 to gear power</li>
                            <li><b>S</b> - adds +6 to gear power</li>
                            <li><b>L</b> - does not increase gear power
                                <ul class="sublist">
                                    <li>- Scales by adding the total of the players two highest stats together</li>
                                    <li>- Uses highest stat the player currently has</li>
                                    <li>- Forces at least one starred affix (special effect)</li>
                                    <li>- Allows equipping two of the same item</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            In Dead Cells, gear is a major part of how you play the game and what decisions you make throughout a run. For this reason, it is important to know what the different
                            symbols represent and while I covered some of the basics here, there is quite a lot that goes into calculating how much damage and what kind of effects any particular 
                            weapon will have.
