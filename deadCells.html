                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; Dead Cells is a roguelike video game developed and published by Motion Twin. In Dead Cells you take the role of an 
                        amorphous creature puppeteering a decapitated corpse in a dungeon, through which you must fight your way out. You gain 
                        various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated, or randomly generated, levels to fight 
                        undead creatures within it. At times, you gain "cells", a type of in-game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades 
                        or unlock items. Dead Cells uses a permadeath system, which means you lose all cells and other currencies and items upon each instance of death.

                    <h2>Biomes</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; Biomes are the different areas within Dead Cells that you must travel through to complete the game. The base game currently has 15 main biomes and 
                        4 boss biomes, however the current DLC's available add another 7 main biomes and 6 more boss biomes.  The order in which biomes are encountered, 
                        and the general location of their links, are predetermined. A link is the doorway to the next stage and multiple links can be found in any given biome.
                        And while the location and ordering of the biomes are predetermined, they are divided into levels and only one biome of each level can be accessed in a 
                        run which gives you a lot of flexibility and change each run. A map of the biomes and their ordering can be found <a href="./assests/deadcells/deadCells_map.png" target="_blank">here</a> 
                        or on the <a href="https://deadcells.fandom.com/wiki/Biomes_Map" target="_blank">fandom wiki</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; Within each run, biomes are procedurally generated within the confines of that biome's set parameters. This puts the focus of gameplay on a combination
                        of on the moment adaptation and memorization, with each biome having a distinct feel. Each biome also has a set of enemies that you will encounter, 
                        some of them are unique to a specific biome. Higher difficulties change the enemy distribution up.
