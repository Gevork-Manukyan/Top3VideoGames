                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp; People have always played games throughout history. From the classics like chess and card
                        games, to the more modern board games and video games, people have always loved putting
                        their skills to the test. And with the invention of video games, came a new boom for gaming as it openned
                        the door for endless possibilities. With the limitations of the physical world removed, more and more people
                        flocked to cyber space. Today gaming has become one of the most common hobbies among the new generation, and 
                        over the years people have carved out subcommunities or genres within the gaming world based on the style of games 
                        they enjoy. These genres range from first person shooters, to singleplayer story games, to MMO RPGs, and 
                        tons more. There is one specific genre of games, however, that I really enjoy playing playing are roguelikes.
